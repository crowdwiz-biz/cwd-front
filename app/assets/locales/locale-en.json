Its essence is that any user of the platform can freeze part of their CWD assets, thus temporarily withdrawing them from circulation. As the CWD becomes less freely available, this increases the value of the asset at the moment. For the fact that users freeze their assets, the system pays them a reward in CWD. The key feature of this staking method is that the amount of remuneration is determined by the community using regular voting using the Crowd Wisdom method. On this tab, you can vote for staking percentages for 3, 6, and 12 months. You can only vote once per vote. Only accounts that have previously used staking are allowed to vote.",
        "description_02": "Voting is carried out using CWD - you send as a vote the amount of CWD that you would like to receive as a percentage of the Deposit for the selected staking period. When voting, you should try to think in a balanced way, determine the percentage for which you would be interested in freezing your CWD, but at the same time understand that too high percentages can negatively affect the activity of the entire platform and the community, since there will be too much CWD, and this can lead to a decrease in its value. After voting, all votes for each staking period will be processed as follows: 10% of the highest and 10% of the lowest interest rates will be excluded from the calculations, and the arithmetic average will be calculated from the remaining votes. This result will be accepted as the interest rate for the next quarter.",
